#### https://shortlink-pi.vercel.app/

just messing up with new Next.js' middleware feature (https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware).

to run this project locally just change the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (to a MySQL database, but you can change it on the prisma config if you want to), run `yarn prisma db push` and then `yarn dev`.

_the link is not \*so\* short because i don't have a short domain :)_
